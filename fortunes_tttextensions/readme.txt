This is an assortment of stuff I've made for my server over the years. If it doesn't really fit anywhere else, I put it here.
It includes:
	a jumppack/booster thing for players
		edit it sh_cyber.lua
	a rank/title system for the TTT scoreboard. uses my ranking system and the title system included
		edit in sh_extend.lua

	the title system is meant to be used with some ULX commands I made which are included in this addon pack, you can find them in fortunes_ulx_commands_ttt
